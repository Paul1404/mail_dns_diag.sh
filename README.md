## ðŸš€ Quick Start (One-liner)

Run the latest version directly (requires `bash` and `dig`):

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paul1404/mail_dns_diag.sh/refs/heads/main/mail_dns_diag.sh) yourdomain.com [dkim_selector]
```

- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain.
- Optionally provide a DKIM selector (e.g., `default`, `mail`, `mailcow`).
